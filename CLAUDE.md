# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a blog repository that appears to be in its initial setup phase. The repository is currently empty except for Claude Code configuration files.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as a typical blog project directory. When files are added, they will likely follow common blog frameworks like:
- Static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js, etc.)
- Content management systems
- Custom blog implementations

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, the development setup will depend on the blog framework chosen. Common patterns include:

- **Package managers**: npm, yarn, or pnpm for Node.js-based projects
- **Build tools**: Webpack, Vite, or framework-specific build systems
- **Content**: Markdown files for blog posts
- **Static assets**: Images, CSS, JavaScript files

## Common Commands

Once a blog framework is set up, typical commands will include:
- Development server (e.g., `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`)
- Build process (e.g., `npm run build`, `yarn build`)
- Testing (if applicable)
- Deployment scripts

## Notes

- This repository currently contains only Claude Code configuration
- The specific blog framework and structure will be determined when files are added
- Update this file once the blog framework and build system are established
